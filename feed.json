One 40x40cm window in the front with a vent (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Yx3Czq\">Amazon.de</a>) and a 28x28cm window (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/35uPgBb\">Amazon.de</a>) in the back. This setup allows for a nice cross ventilation while maximizing the total solar power without having to use an additional roof rack that would increase the vehicle height, weight, wind resistance and recognizability. Basically, this is the simplest and cheapest setup I could come up with that satisfies all our electrical, thermal and light requirements.</p>\n<p>Most people buy their solar panels as a kit that comes with a cable roof duct and the construction glue. I advise against this, because the cable roof ducts are pure crap. They only allow a limited number of cables and cannot be opened at a later time in order to add an additional cable, which means you would have to drill another hole into your van. We have used an extendable, reusable cable roof duct and we have placed it below our solar panels, in order to maximize protection against rain. If you want to do this, make sure that you position the roof duct correctly, because the alumium profiles and the aluminium support of the solar panels can get in the way otherwise. We have inserted a total of five cables, two for the solar panels, two for the LTE antenna and one for the GPS antenna. The screws that hold the cover are protected against rain with simple duct tape.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/29/IMG_2997.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p>The Fiat Ducato / Peugeot Boxer / Citroen Jumper/Relay come with mounting points for a roof rack. However, I have found these roof racks to be ridiculously expensive. Therefore, we decided to glue two simple 3N aluminium profiles to the sheet metal of the roof, which is both cheap and flexible due to the amount of mounting points in the aluminium profiles. The key is to make sure that the solar panels fit correctly by preparing everything on the floor. Once the aluminium profiles are glued to the metal you have very little time to make adjustments.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/29/camphoto_1254324197.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p>You will need to create custom 90 degree angle adapters. This is both easy and cheap, even cheaper than buying ready to use angle adapters. Buy a 90 degree aluminium bar in your favorite local hardware store, cut it with a miter saw to the correct dimensions and drill a couple of 7mm holes to connect the aluminium profiles with the alumium mounting support of the solar panels using 6mm machine screws and spring washers. Spring washers are very important, as the vehicle constantly moves and you don't want your solar panels to fly off the roof while driving.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/29/camphoto_1483920592.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\"></p>\n<p>After dry fitting everything together, think about how you want to connect your solar panels. We have four solar panels and we chose to wire them together in series and then in parallel, giving us the benefits of both worlds. Wiring in series means that the solar panels reach the minium charging voltage that the solar charge controller needs in order to start working early in the day. Amazingly, the solar charge controller starts working even before the sun goes up due to the reflections in the atmoshpere. Wiring all four solar panels in series would not have improved this any further, because once the voltage threshhold is reached, charging begins. Therefore we wired the two serial \"panel pairs\" together in parallel, so that we only loose half of our charging power if one of our solar panels is shadowed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/29/solar-verkabelung.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2151\"></p>\n<p>After the preparation it is time for the installation. Make sure to clean your roof thouroughly, using alcohol or another suitable cleaner. Dry fit your aluminium profiles and add your solar panels. Mark the position of the solar panels with marking tape. Remove the solar panels and aluminium profiles. If your constructions glue requires a primer, use a primer. If not, directly add the glue to the roof. Stick on your aluminium profiles on both sides of the vehicle. Remove the marking tape and immediately add the solar panels. This is necessary so that the glue is distributed evenly (the roof has a curvature, which the glue needs to even out). Make sure to connect all cables before fixing all panels in position with the machine screws and spring washers.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you do not distinguish charging and discharging circuits (most installations don't), wire in a kill switch into the positive line going to the solar charge controller. This allows you to disable your electric setup in case of troubleshooting. Otherwise, you may have electricity in your circuits even if your battery kill switch is activated. Also remember to use appropiately sized wires from the solar charge controller to the battery, as the solar charge controller typically decreases the voltage from the solar panels to the 12V voltage of the battery bank, therefore requiring a larger wire diameter. Also wire in a fuse in accordance with the manual of the solar charge controller that you use.</p>",

            "summary": "Andalucía has it all: beaches, mountains, countryside, pueblos blancos and friendly people. It is also a region of wine, delicious food and flamenco. To get a taste of everything we tried to take our time&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Andalucía has it all: beaches, mountains, countryside, <i>pueblos blancos</i> and friendly people. It is also a region of wine, delicious food and flamenco. To get a taste of everything we tried to take our time with this roadtrip. However, even with around 20 days in Andalucía, we have not managed to finish our to do list.</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this post, you will only find our favourite places where we have stopped on our way to Portugal. One little disclaimer: In case you were hoping to read something about the city of Málaga, Marbella or Nerja - we have to disappoint you. Since we both have been there before, on this trip we left it out to see more of the hilly inland. We can highly recommend visiting Málaga though, but you will not read about these places here. So without further ado, where have we been? </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e6lrq8oh0\" class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Granada</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Of course, everybody knows about the <strong>Alhambra</strong> and Generalife, the gardens surrounding Alhambra. This UNESCO World Heritage site is one of the most visited sites in all Spain. This time, we have not gone inside but instead enjoyed Granada on foot and by this, have only seen the Alhambra with the snowcapped Sierra Nevada in the background from a distance. Let me tell you: Granada is more than just the Alhambra. Especially barrio <strong>Albaicín </strong>(Albayzín) is really worth a stroll. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/Alhambra.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/Alhambra-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Granada Alhambra view\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/Granda-blick.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/Granda-blick-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Granada Albaicin\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/Granda.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/Granda-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Granada\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\">For a vegan treat, we found the little <strong>I Need __</strong> coffee shop. Delicious coffee and a really tasty ginger and walnut cake.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/coffee-granada-i-need.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e6lshqlu1\" class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ronda</span></h2>\n<p>Ronda should be on your list for sure. Why? Well for one, the view of this village in the mountainous area is impressive. The center is divided by the Guadalevin river, which makes for the unique setting on top of <strong>El Tajo canyon</strong>. With the beautiful Puente Nuevo bridge the sight calls for many tourists each year. If you want to avoid other tourists at all costs, the city center of Ronda might not be for you. Instead, head for the rural surroundings where you can enjoy beautiful views of the bridge as well - in our opinion, even more beautiful. The region is perfect for little hikes, for example to Cueva del Gato. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/ronda-view.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/ronda-view-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/ronda-horse.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/ronda-horse-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/cueva-gato.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/cueva-gato-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After Ronda, on the way down to the ocean again, there is another <em>pueblo blanco</em> we can recommend: <strong>Casares</strong> and with it, the nearby <em>Baños romanos de la Hedionda</em>. Stop there and take a quick sulphur bath - it is free, supposedly good for your health, around 20 degrees Celsius warm and at least in February there where only some locals around. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/banos-romanos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\"></span></p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1e6mhrioa0\" class=\"p1\">By the way, before we came to Ronda, we also visited little Iznajar. If you have endless time, Iznajar can be worth a trip. It is pretty, but pretty small, too. It can easily be explored in half a day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e6lucmon0\" class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tarifa and La Pena</span></h2>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1e6lucspe1\" class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before we arrived in Tarifa, we spent some quiet days on the beach just before Gibraltar. Around Playa de la Alcaidesa you can park a van easily and enjoy the calm </span>Mediterranean <span class=\"s1\">Sea. You can walk or jog along the beach up to Gibraltar, which we have done, but other than that, we stayed outside of this <em>British Overseas Territory. </em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/playa-gibraltar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\"></em></span></p>\n<p>So, after some much needed beach time, Tarifa was the next stop on our trip. Tarifa is quite nice, and I bet can be a lot of fun. However, in February almost everything was closed. Also, unfortunaltey, we do not yet know how to kitesurf. That is why we stayed not directly in Tarifa, but in the region of La Pena next to Tarifa with beaches, nature, animals and beautiful hikes. And it is true: You will wake up next to grazing cows. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/la-pena-cow.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/la-pena-cow-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"La pena\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/tarifa.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/tarifa-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tarifa\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/la-pena.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/la-pena-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"La pena\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e6mdo6pj0\">Calas de Conil, Cádiz and Jerez</h2>\n<p>Do not head directly to Sevilla. On your way up some pretty amazing spots await. Start by relaxing one day or two at Calas de Conil or Calas de Roche. Than enjoy culture and food in Cádiz. And end with sherry and music in Jerez de la Frontera.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/cala-conil.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/cala-conil-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"cala conil\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/cadiz.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/cadiz-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"cadiz\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/jerez.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/jerez-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"jerez\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Our highlight: vegan tapas! We can especially recommend the vegan food stall <em>Las ninas veganas</em>. It is located in the <em>Mercado Central </em>in <strong>Cadiz</strong><em> </em>and has the <strong>best vegan tapas</strong>: Spinach nuts and beet balls, Cauliflower balls with beet hummus, Aubergine balls ... just to name a few. Sooo good. And have some cold, local beer with the tapas. </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/ninas-veganas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e6metojk0\" class=\"p1\">Sevilla</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bright, colourful, lively. That is Sevilla, Andalusia’s capital. Here, you have it all: culture, museums, and architecture - the Cathedral, the Giralda, Plaza de Espana, or the palace complex Alcazár, just to name a few -, shopping possibilities, the river Guadalquivir with its lovely river banks and with a lot of water sports going on, green grassy chill out areas and electronic music festivals. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/sevilla-houses.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/sevilla-houses-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/sevilla-river.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/sevilla-river-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/sevilla.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/28/gallery/sevilla-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And of course: vegan food.

            "content_html": "<p>The idea behind our shower is simple. <em>What is the minimal amount of space that you need in order to comfortably get clean in a van?</em> There are many different answers to this problem. We chose to build a <strong>waist high shower box</strong> that serves as storage for dirty laundry and as an extension of our kitchen countertop when the shower is not in use, which is... 99% of the time. We feel like this way we don't waste any space for the little amount of time that we actually spend showering.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Some links may be affiliate links and if you go through them to make a purchase we will earn a commission<strong> </strong>– at no extra cost to you.</p>\n<p>Our shower box is 70cm wide, 60cm deep and about 70cm tall. We <strong>raised the bottom</strong> of the shower box about 20cm in order to make room for water pipes, wires and air pipes, so that the top of our shower box aligns with the rest of the kitchen countertop, which sits at about 90cm. The raised bottom also helps in getting in and out of the shower, because you don't need to raise your leg that high. The box is slightly wider than it is deep in order to take into accocunt the curved walls of the van. You may need to adjust these measurements to your situation.</p>\n<p>The first step was to <strong>cut the bottom and side pieces</strong> out of 15mm lightweight plywood to the desired dimensions. We then <strong>routered grooves</strong> into the plywood for the <strong>magnets </strong>(<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2J5Naxb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.com</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39cZAOp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.de</a>) that will ensure that the shower curtain does not cling to your body when the hot steam of the shower rises to the top. After that, we assembled the basic box with screws and wood glue using clamps and custom made 90 degree helpers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/22/build-a-box-small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"583\"></p>\n<p>The next step was to make the box as water tight as possible by applying some sort of primer and multiple layers of a liquid waterproofing membrane. For the edges, we used the additional reinforcements that came with our <strong>waterproofing kit </strong>(<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3acpZNG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.com</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bj1vm6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.de</a>).</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image align-left\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/22/waterproof2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"560\"></p>\n<p>After that we ordered a <strong><a href=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/individual-sized-shower-tub/\">custom size shower tub</a></strong> that comes with a drainage outlet and siphon. This piece of hardware is built according to your dimensions and preferences. Make sure to measure accurately, as you want it to fit inside the box without any gaps. Alternatively, you can order this first and build your box around this, which should make it a little easier.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/22/add-a-shower-tub.small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"665\"></p>\n<p>After that we <strong>inserted the magnets</strong> into the grooves that we had previously routered and then we glued four 1.5mm <strong>stainless steel sheets</strong> to the inner walls of the box using a polyurethane industrial adhesive (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2U5rxTW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.com</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2U7trU8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.de</a>). Finally, we <strong>siliconed all the edges</strong> in order to prevent any water from leaking. If any water manages to find its way through the cracks, the liquid waterproofing membrane will prevent it from penetrating into the wood.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/22/side-walls.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"465\"></p>\n<p>Finally, the <strong>shower curtain</strong> was modified to include some magnets in the correct positions (matching the magnets in the shower box and in the wood ceiling) and it was also shortened so that it only covers the necessary parts. All in all, we used roughly 50 magnets in the ceiling, the shower box and the curtain.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/22/IMG_3434.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"665\"></p>\n<p>There you have it, a minimal DIY shower that is easy to build and gets out of your way when you don't need it.</p>",

The task of a BMS is to protect a battery and to make sure that it operates within the specifications of the battery cell manufacturer. While you can operate some kind of batteries without a BMS, you should never operate a Lithium battery without a BMS. A BMS can also contain some additional features, such as a <strong>State of Charge</strong> detection (\"how much juice is left?\"), but its core function is to protect the battery from unwanted conditions, such as OVP and UVP and unsupported temperatures.</p>\n<p>Lithium batteries operate within a voltage range. A Lithium battery with a nominal voltage of 12V has an actual voltage of approximately 14,4V when fully charged and about 11V when it is empty. Now, these values are not static or fixed, some people like to charge their Lithium batteries up to 14,6V. This is often a topic of debate, because Lithium batteries tend to have a longer lifespan (measured in charge cycles) when they are not constantly fully charged or fully emptied. In fact, Lithium batteries have a significantly longer life expectation when they are operated around the 50% SoC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e3rffe680\">On the matter of voltage</h2>\n<p>Most 12V appliances can operate within the voltage range that a 12V nominal voltage battery provides. However, some 12V appliances may not work correctly when the system voltage is too low or too high, in which case you could add DC-DC converter, which will regulate the system voltage to constant 12V at the expense of a certain efficiency rate (such as 96%).</p>\n<p>When you buy a charger for your battery, you must ensure that it is compatible with your battery in terms of the type of chemistry and system voltage. You should never use a lead acid battery charger on a lithium battery and vice versa, because these chargers have different cutoff voltages and charging methods or algorithms. A charging method or algorithm determines how a battery is charged over time.</p>\n<p>In order to protect the Lithium battery cells from being over charged, we need <strong>Over Voltage Protection</strong> (OVP). Similarly, we need <strong>Under Voltage Protection</strong> (UVP), sometimes also referred to as Low Voltage Protection (LVP) to protect the cells from being discharged beyond it's specifications. If you charge or discharge your battery without OVP and UVP, you can permanently damage the cells, which may cause them to be unusable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e3rffe680\">Battery cells - the building blocks of your battery</h2>\n<p>Now, every battery is made up of individual <strong>cells</strong> that are usually wired together in series. In the case of a 12V LiFePo4 battery, each of the four cells that are necessary to create a working battery may have a voltage of 3,6V when the complete battery is fully charged (4 cells * 3,6V = 14,4V). However, in reality, these cells are likely not to have the same voltage. They are more likely to diverge slightly, as their chemical properties may differ slightly and change over time. Here is an example of what your cells voltage might look like if it is 100% charged.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cell</th>\n<th>Voltage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3,59</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3,60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3,61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3,60</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Because every cell has slightly different chemical characteristics, some cells may be fully charged before other cells. In order to still reach the 14,4V, the charger keeps charging. If the fully charged cell continues to charge, it would be overcharged and thus damaged. It is the task of so called <strong>cell balancers</strong> to make sure that individual cells are charged equally. These balancers are typically electric components that are mounted directly on top of the individual cell terminals. Balancing can be done by actively routing the charging current to the cells that needs it (\"active balancing\") or by simply converting the superfluous charging current to heat by means of a simple resistor (which may require a heat dissipation device, such as a fan or heat sink).</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e3rffe680\">Relays and Hysteresis</h2>\n<p>Cell balancers may also measure the voltage of the cell they are mounted to and signal an over voltage or under voltage to an upstream device called \"<strong>relay</strong>\". You can think of a relay as a remotely controlled switch, that switches an electrical connection based on the information it gets. For instance, if one cell balancer singals an under voltage situation to the relay input of a 230V inverter, the inverter may switch it's electrical connection to the battery off. Relays exist in various form factors.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, a <strong>hysteresis</strong> function helps to detect temporary low or high voltage situations. For instance, a coffee machine has a very high electrical demand when it brews, causing a high dip in system voltage for a very short amount of time. In it's simplest form, a hysteresis function requires a certain amount of time to pass before it signals under voltage. Some systems have multiple OVP or LVP functions, allowing for instance a voltage level of 11,2V to exist for 30 seconds, but cutting off directly at 11V.</p>\n</div>",

None of the listed panel vans can be ordered with a gas engine, which means that pretty much all the vans you see within Europe run with on <strong>diesel</strong>. While some panel vans can be ordered with an <strong><em>electric motor</em></strong>, there are a number of drawbacks that need to be considered. Apart from the often mentioned<strong> <em>range anxiety</em></strong>, the <em><strong>lack of charging infrastructure</strong></em>, the <strong><em>hefty price tag</em></strong> (roughly 70.000 for an Iveco Daily Electric), there is a more fundamental problem. The weight of the batteries simply does not allow for such a van to be properly converted to a camper van under the 3.5 ton limit. Currently, electric vans are simply <strong>too heavy</strong>.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>On our way to escape winter in Germany we made it quickly through France and wanted to reach southern Spain as fast as possible - winter was coming. However, Spain's north already enticed with springlike sun and beautiful coastlines. Also, Valencia happened to be on the way south. And we stayed for a little bit longer to fall in love with this city. </strong></p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1e2hb67iq0\">Valencia is Spain's third biggest city - after Madrid and Bareclona - and it is the capital of the region as well as of the autonomous community also named Valencia (Spain and its <em>municipios</em>, <em>provincias</em> and <em>comunidades autonomas</em>...). It is located in the <em>Levante, la costa levantina, </em>which refers to Spain's east and the location on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Let me tell you: Despite the beautiful location and its size it still offers quite a calm atmosphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e28o2ut80\">Slow and spacious</h2>\n<p>So, even though around 800.000 people live in this beautiful city, it just does not feel crowded, let alone jammed with cars. In the city center or on shopping streets, we felt like we had enough air to breathe and space to stop for enjoyable rests. Nobody pushed us around while strolling slowly. It was not overcrowded with tourists although it definitely has the potential. Is this only due to off-season?</p>\n<p>What is more: When you need a different scenery, you have perfect conditions. Stunning mountains, natural parks and hikes in the backyard and a huge stretch of beach in its frontyard give you many possibilities to stretch your legs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e28p6rsu1\">Bike-friendly Valencia</h2>\n<p>Talking about stretching your legs: Valencians ride two-wheelers, bikes or e-scooters. No wonder, because Valencia really is perfect to explore by bike. According to Wikipedia the city offers 108 km of bike lanes and EuroVelo, the network of cycling routes across Europe, passes through Valencia as well. Since we love riding bikes, we knew how we wanted to get through the city. Luckily, travelling in a camper also means you have everything you need with you. That is true for our bikes as well. </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/11/valencia-bike.JPG\" alt=\"Valencia by bike\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\"></p>\n<p>How was the biking experience? After you identify the bike lanes and get to know the street grid a little bit better, you manage just perfectly. Bigger streets offer seperate bike lanes in grass green. Smaller ones are directly labled as bike roads: cars are only allowed to drive 30km/h and are advised to pay attention to byciclists. Be aware: If there is a seperate bike lane, even when it is on the other side of the road (one bike lane often offers both directions), make sure to use it. Otherwise, cars might honk at you. </p>\n<p>If you don't have your bike with you, no problem. There are plenty of bike rental shops in Valencia. Even better: Try Valenbisi (as in: Valencia bicicleta Sí!) with several stations across the city. Park and ride, ride and park - the better hop-on-hop-off service if you ask me. You can reach all the sights the city has to offer, and even the ones a bit further away. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e28q27en2\">What to see in Valencia?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Definitely all the green there is, especially the park in the former Turia river, that went through Valencia: <strong>El Jardín del Turia</strong>. The \"Turia garden\" in the center stretches all the way from the <em>Parque de Cabecera and Bioparc</em> down to the port of Valencia. Grab your bike and enjoy the ride under impressive bridges along orange trees and flowers. It is beautiful and sets the stage for outdoor activities like jogging, playing soccer or dancing. Even with all the bridges crossing the park it is hard to imagine that this park has been a river before. And it is even harder to imagine that after the big flood in 1957, government officials wanted to convert this area into more space for cars and roads. But luckily, <em>valencians </em>demanded to convert it into green space for the city. </li>\n<li>When you ride or stroll along the Jardin del Turia in direction of the port, you won't miss it: la <i>Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències, </i>the <strong>City of Arts and Sciences. </strong>(Is it just me or does it sound as if it were a place of GOT?) This cultural and architectural area is stunning, even if you don't go inside any of the buildings.<br><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/11/valencia-art-science.jpg\" alt=\"Valencia\" width=\"2000\" height=\"4000\"></li>\n<li>You really feel a metropolitan and lively but releaxed Valencian atmosphere when hopping through <strong>cafés and shops in Russafa/Ruzafa</strong>. The neighbourhood has a lot of character and is best explored by foot or bike. Just take your time, stroll through the streets and quiet your sweet cravings at places like the <em>Dulce de Leche Boutique</em>, a coffee shop in Carrer del Pintor Gisbert, with some vegan options - despite the name. </li>\n<li>Another barrio to see is <strong>El Carmen</strong> with all its street art, tapas bars and culture. If you are a vegan and in need of coffee you want to visit <em>Almalibre Açaí House Valencia</em> in Carrer de Roteros 16. <br><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/11/valencia-el-carmen.jpg\" alt=\"Valencia El Carmen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"2000\"></li>\n<li>If you have some spare time and a bike, go further until <strong>Port Sa Platja. </strong>Firstly, you will ride along the beautiful beachside boardwalk. And secondly, Port Sa Platja really feels like little Venice and impresses with colorful buidlings.<br><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://twoandahalfvan.eu/media/posts/11/valencia-port.jpg\" alt=\"Valencia\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\"></li>\n<li>Last but not least: Enjoy the beach of course :) </li>\n</ol>",
